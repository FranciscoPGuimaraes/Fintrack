fix(project): Login, User Registration, and Database Operations

This update includes corrections to the login and user
registration processes, ensuring a proper authentication
flow with securely hashed passwords. Improvements were
made to user creation to enhance security. The
`get_all_users` and `get_user_by_email_for_auth`
functions were optimized with refined SQL queries
and better error handling. PEP8-compliant documentation
was added across all modules, and the main application 
try point was streamlined for easier deployment with
Uvicorn.
