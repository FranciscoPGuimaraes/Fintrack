feat(docker-compose): add Jenkins, Neo4j, and Redis containers  

Added a `docker-compose` configuration with three
containers: Jenkins, built using a custom Dockerfile;
Neo4j, a graph database; and Redis, a caching and
messaging in-memory store. Successfully configured
and launched all three containers, including build
and deployment steps.
